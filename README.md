# LRU_2Q alghorithm
This project is a realization of LRU_2Q algorithm. 
It could more suitable than LRU in cases when we have a requests for recent pages and for popular pages too.
This realization can demonstrate count of cache hit on long int requests (numbers imitate pages).
## Compilation
You can compile programm with command: `make all`, and call it: `./LRU_2Q`.
## Built-in tests
To compile in test running: `make test`, and call it: `./LRU_2Q`.
